    """Estimate next NSD numbers based on historical submission rate.

    The prediction is calculated from the most recent ``window_days`` worth
    of stored records. It computes the average number of submissions per
    day and multiplies by the number of days since the last known NSD. The
    ``safety_factor`` parameter is applied to avoid underestimation.

    Args:
        repository: Data source providing access to stored NSDs.
        window_days: Number of days used to calculate the average rate.
        safety_factor: Multiplier to account for variations in publishing
            behaviour.

    Returns:
        A list of sequential NSD values likely to have been published
        after the last stored record.
