# Finance Ledger Yearly (FLY)

### What is This?
Finance Ledger Yearly (**FLY**) is a comprehensive **financial data app** designed to automate the extraction and processing of financial data from various online sources. The app retrieves detailed company information, financial documents, and **standardized financial statements**, storing this data in a local database for easy access and analysis.

## How It Works, Behind the Wheels
1. **Company Information Scraping**  
   - Finds company names, tickers, sectors, and registration data.
   - Saves the latest updates to avoid redundant data.

2. **Financial Reports Processing**  
   - Extracts and standardizes company financial statements.
   - Ensures that data follows a structured, readable format.
   - Only updates reports if new information is available.

3. **NSD (Document Number) Tracking**  
   - Keeps track of financial disclosure documents.
   - Fills in missing document sequences intelligently.

4. **Stock Market & Corporate Events Analysis**  
   - Fetches stock prices, stock splits, and dividend information.
   - Matches stock performance with financial statements.

5. **Performance & Optimization**
   - Uses a multi-threaded system to process data efficiently.
   - Tracks memory and execution time to keep things running smoothly.
